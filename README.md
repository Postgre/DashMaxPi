# DashMaxPi

** **Currently Unfinished** **

A lighttpd PHP dashboard for the raspberry pi.

This is a small dhasboard that lets you see the status of services running on your Raspberry Pi. Simply set a username and password to access the dashboard and then add the names of the services you wish to keep track of. It also shows the ping time from your RPI to google.com.
